Nomad Hub is envisioned as a comprehensive platform designed to enhance the remote work experience and foster a vibrant community of remote professionals. The project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that streamlines the process of discovering, sharing, and collaborating within various remote workspaces. Specifically, the system is designed to:

•	List places for remote work.
•	Provide a form for adding new places.
•	Offer recommendations of places for users.
•	Enable users to rate places they have visited.
•	Facilitate communication between users through messaging.
